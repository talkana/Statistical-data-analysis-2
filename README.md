# Statistical-data-analysis-2
Programming projects from Statistical data analysis 2 - a course covering bayesian statistics and bayesian machine learning.

The purpose of project 1 was to use variational autoencoders to model and sample gene expression data.

Project 2 contains an implementation of Gibbs sampler for a small bayesian network.
