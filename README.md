# Applying a variational autoencoder to scRNA data
This project was conducted as part of Statistical Data Analysis 2, a course focused on Bayesian statistics and Bayesian machine learning. The primary objective was to model gene expression data from a single-cell experiment using a variational autoencoder (VAE). While this project has some room for improvement in terms of both the analysis and the code usability, it covers the essential decisions and processes involved in modeling data using VAE, such as:

1. Data Exploration: the goal here is to identify the most suitable family of prior distributions.
2. Implementation and Training of VAE using the PyTorch framework.
3. Latent Space Visualization: the goal here is to explore the VAE's learned representations and assess whether observations of the same cell types exhibit clustering within the latent space.
